# Classification and Analysis of Neurological Signals

Final project for Classification and Analysis of Neurological Signals. <br />
<br />
ABSTRACT: This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the correlates of remembering previously experienced events. Three young healthy adults listened to "old" meaningful sentences which they had studied 24 hr previously. As a control task the subjects listened to comparable "new" sentences that they had never heard before. During the process of encoding as well as recollection of the sentences, the participants’ brain activity was monitored. The main hypothesis of this experiment is to check whether correct encoding in memory leads to correct retrieval in certain events, which in this case is an auditory stimuli in the form of ‘sentences’. Conversely, it also checks whether incorrect encoding leads to wrong retrieval of certain incidents or events.
